Original map elevation created using public US-based LIDAR height maps, slightly tweaked through the use of photo editing software and fed through Unreal Engine 4 to create the base landscape.
Different variations of auto-materials, tweaked for several seasons of the year, are controlled through a couple of simple number edits, easily accessible without ever looking at code.
Auto-materials include all the different textures as well as trees, rocks, grass, and many other small details, optimized for large worlds to run on mid-range systems.
